# TASK-003 Deployment Postmortem

**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Incident**: Failed deployment attempt on production beta environment
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Impact**: Production beta temporarily unavailable, multiple failed deployment attempts
**Resolution**: Production restored to stable main branch

---

## üìã Executive Summary

During TASK-003 (work order and material routes extraction), a deployment was attempted directly on the production beta environment without proper testing infrastructure. This resulted in:

- **5 import dependency errors** discovered in production
- **Multiple failed deployments** disrupting service availability
- **Incorrect deployment strategy** (testing on production instead of isolated environment)
- **2 hours of troubleshooting** before production restoration

**Root Cause**: Inadequate pre-deployment testing and wrong deployment target selection.

**Resolution**: Production beta restored to stable main branch and verified operational.

---

## üîç What Happened - Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment (T+0:00)
- TASK-003 code completed locally with 2 new router files
- Code pushed to GitHub (PR #6 created)
- Deployment attempted directly on production beta environment
- **Decision Point Missed**: Should have created test environment first

### Phase 2: First Error - Dockerfile (T+0:15)
- **Error**: `Package 'libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev' has no installation candidate`
- **Action**: Updated Dockerfile to use `libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-dev`
- **Commit**: 9789bbe
- **Result**: Fixed, but revealed next error

### Phase 3: Second Error - Service Imports (T+0:30)
- **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'services.database_user_service'`
- **Root Cause**: Services are in database.py, not separate module files
- **Action**: Changed imports in both router files
- **Commit**: 2f47b1f
- **Result**: Fixed, but revealed next error

### Phase 4: Third Error - Auth Dependencies (T+0:45)
- **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_current_user_from_cookie' from 'app.dependencies.auth'`
- **Root Cause**: Auth module only exists on TASK-001 branch
- **Action**: Added 54-line inline auth implementation to both routers
- **Commit**: 2f47b1f (same)
- **Result**: Fixed, but revealed next error

### Phase 5: Fourth Error - Logger Import (T+1:00)
- **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_logger' from 'config'`
- **Root Cause**: get_logger is in error_handling.logging_config, not config
- **Action**: Updated import paths in both routers
- **Commit**: c362787
- **Result**: Fixed, but revealed final error

### Phase 6: Fifth Error - Templates Import (T+1:15)
- **Error**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'templates' from 'config'`
- **Root Cause**: templates is defined in main.py, not config.py
- **Action**: None taken - recognized as architectural issue
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED - still blocking

### Phase 7: User Feedback & Realization (T+1:30)
- **User**: "bad testing deployment strategy was implemented"
- **Realization**: Should have used separate test environment
- **Recognition**: Testing on production beta was wrong approach
- **Decision**: Stop fixing, restore production first

### Phase 8: Production Restoration (T+1:45 - T+2:00)
- Switched droplet to main branch
- Reset to origin/main
- Cherry-picked Dockerfile fix
- Rebuilt container with stable code
- Verified operational
- **Result**: Production beta restored and healthy

## üí• Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause
**Inadequate Pre-Deployment Testing Process**

The TASK-003 code was never tested in a running environment before deployment. Import paths were assumed to be correct based on local syntax checking, but runtime dependencies were not verified.

### Contributing Factors

#### 1. **Missing Dependency Analysis**
- No mapping of all import dependencies before extraction
- Didn't verify that imported modules exist on target branch
- Assumed service structure without checking actual implementation
- No validation of shared resource locations (templates, config, etc.)

#### 2. **Wrong Deployment Target**
- Deployed directly to production beta environment
- No separate test environment created
- Treated production as a testing ground
- No rollback plan before starting

#### 3. **Branch Independence Issues**
- TASK-003 branch doesn't have code from TASK-001 (auth module)
- Each task branch was developed independently
- No integration testing between branches
- Dependencies across branches not documented

#### 4. **Iterative Fixes in Production**
- Fixed errors one-by-one in production
- Each fix required rebuild and redeployment
- Multiple failed starts accumulated downtime
- No stopping after first error to reassess strategy

#### 5. **Incomplete Testing Strategy**
- Local syntax checking only (py_compile)
- No local runtime testing
- No import validation
- No container build testing locally

---

## üéØ What Should Have Happened

### Correct Pre-Deployment Process

#### Step 1: Local Development Testing
```bash
# After creating router files, test locally BEFORE committing
cd /Users/rafaellang/cotizador/cotizador_ventanas

# 1. Syntax check
python -m py_compile app/routes/work_orders.py
python -m py_compile app/routes/materials.py
python -m py_compile main.py

# 2. Import validation
python -c "from app.routes import work_orders"
python -c "from app.routes import materials"

# 3. Test server startup
python main.py &
SERVER_PID=$!
sleep 10

# 4. Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/work-orders

# 5. Stop server
kill $SERVER_PID

# If all pass, THEN commit and push
```

#### Step 2: Local Docker Testing
```bash
# Test Docker build locally
docker build -t ventanas-test:task-003 .

# If build fails, fix locally BEFORE pushing

# Test container startup
docker run -d --name ventanas-test -p 8001:8000 ventanas-test:task-003
sleep 10
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Stop test container
docker stop ventanas-test
docker rm ventanas-test
```

#### Step 3: Create Test Environment on Droplet
```bash
# SSH to droplet
ssh root@159.65.174.94

# Create test docker-compose configuration
cd /home/ventanas/app
cp docker-compose.beta.yml docker-compose.test.yml

# Edit docker-compose.test.yml:
# - Change container names (ventanas-test-*)
# - Change ports (8001:8000, 5433:5432, 6380:6379)
# - Change network name (ventanas-test-network)
# - Use separate database (test_ventanas)
```

#### Step 4: Deploy to Test Environment
```bash
# Clone repo to separate test directory
cd /home/ventanas
git clone https://github.com/ramphastoslangosta/cotizador_ventanas.git app-test
cd app-test

# Checkout test branch
git checkout refactor/workorder-material-routes-20250929

# Deploy to test environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build

# Test thoroughly
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health
curl http://localhost:8001/work-orders
# ... run full test checklist ...
```

#### Step 5: Only After Test Success
- Merge to main branch
- Deploy to production beta
- Monitor carefully

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Strategies

### Immediate Actions (Before Next Deployment)

#### 1. Create Test Environment Infrastructure
**Owner**: DevOps / Developer
**Timeline**: Before any TASK-003 retry
**Deliverable**: Functional test environment on droplet

```bash
# On droplet: /home/ventanas/app-test/
# - Separate directory
# - Separate containers
# - Separate ports
# - Separate database
# - Test docker-compose configuration
```

#### 2. Document Testing Checklist
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Immediate
**Deliverable**: Testing checklist document

Create **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** with:
- Pre-commit tests (syntax, imports, local run)
- Pre-push tests (Docker build, container start)
- Pre-deployment tests (test environment validation)
- Post-deployment tests (health check, route testing)

#### 3. Fix TASK-003 Templates Issue
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Before next deployment attempt
**Deliverable**: Working templates import

**Recommended Solution**: Move templates to config.py
```python
# In config.py:
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")
```

### Short-Term Improvements (Next Sprint)

#### 1. **Pre-Deployment Validation Script**
Create `scripts/validate-deployment.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated pre-deployment validation

echo "=== Pre-Deployment Validation ==="

# 1. Syntax check all Python files
echo "Checking syntax..."
find . -name "*.py" -exec python -m py_compile {} \;

# 2. Test imports
echo "Validating imports..."
python -c "from main import app; print('‚úì Main imports OK')"

# 3. Build Docker image
echo "Testing Docker build..."
docker build -t test-build:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) .

# 4. Test container startup
echo "Testing container startup..."
# ... container test logic ...

echo "=== All Validations Passed ==="
```

#### 2. **Branch Integration Testing**
Since tasks are developed on independent branches:
- Create integration branch before deployment
- Merge all pending task branches
- Test integrated code
- Only deploy integrated code

#### 3. **Deployment Runbook**
Document standard deployment procedure:
1. Validate locally
2. Build and test in test environment
3. Run full test checklist
4. Deploy to staging (if available)
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor and verify

### Long-Term Improvements (Next Quarter)

#### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
Set up GitHub Actions for:
- Automated testing on push
- Docker build validation
- Import dependency checking
- Automated deployment to test environment

#### 2. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Container health monitoring
- Failed startup alerts
- Error rate monitoring
- Deployment rollback automation

#### 3. **Staging Environment**
- Permanent staging environment separate from production
- Identical configuration to production
- Required testing ground before production deployment

#### 4. **Dependency Analysis Tools**
- Automated import dependency mapping
- Cross-branch dependency visualization
- Pre-commit hooks for dependency validation

## üìä Metrics & Learning

### Time Investment
- **Development**: 3 hours (TASK-003 code)
- **Failed deployment attempts**: 1.5 hours
- **Troubleshooting**: 1 hour
- **Production restoration**: 0.5 hours
- **Documentation**: 1 hour
- **Total**: 7 hours

### If Proper Process Had Been Followed
- **Development**: 3 hours
- **Local testing**: 0.5 hours
- **Test environment setup**: 1 hour (one-time)
- **Test deployment**: 0.5 hours
- **Fixes in test env**: 1 hour
- **Production deployment**: 0.25 hours
- **Total**: 6.25 hours (saves time + no production impact)

### Key Lessons

1. **"Test early, test often"**: Catch issues locally before they reach production
2. **"Production is sacred"**: Never test on production, even beta
3. **"One error signals more"**: First production error should trigger full review, not iterative fixes
4. **"Branch independence requires integration testing"**: Independent branches need integration validation
5. **"Deployment is a process, not an action"**: Follow structured deployment procedures
