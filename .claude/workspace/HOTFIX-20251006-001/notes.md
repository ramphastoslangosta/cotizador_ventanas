**Duration**: ~1 hour

## Timeline

### 19:00 - Issue Reported
User reported critical production bug:
- PDF generation failing with AttributeError
- JavaScript console error: "originalText is not defined"
- Affecting production URLs: quotes/21/pdf and quotes/24/pdf

### 19:05 - Initial Investigation
- Created HOTFIX-20251006-001 task in tasks.csv
- Generated atomic execution plan
- Created workspace directory
- Identified root cause: `company.logo_path` doesn't exist (should be `logo_filename`)

### 19:10 - Implementation Phase 1
- Created hotfix branch: `hotfix/pdf-logo-path-20251006`
- Fixed Company logo_path AttributeError (app/routes/quotes.py:575)
- Commit: 5052c9f

### 19:15 - Implementation Phase 2
- Fixed JavaScript scope error in view_quote.html
- Fixed both `generatePDF()` and `convertToWorkOrder()` functions
- Commit: f97bd57

### 19:20 - Testing Phase
- Created test file: tests/test_pdf_generation.py
- Added 3 test cases for PDF generation scenarios
- Commit: 86ae869

### 19:25 - Branch Context Issue
- Discovered working on wrong branch (perf/n1-query-bom-20251003)
- Switched to correct hotfix branch
- Verified fixes present on hotfix branch

### 19:30 - Docker Deployment Attempt #1
- Built Docker container from wrong branch
- Container had old buggy code
- Stopped and corrected

### 19:35 - Docker Deployment Attempt #2
- Switched to hotfix branch
- Rebuilt container with --no-cache
- Deployed successfully to localhost:8000

### 19:40 - Testing Discovery - Bug #3
User tested and reported new error:
```
Error: 'Quote' object has no attribute 'items'
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- PDF service expected QuoteCalculation Pydantic model
- Route passed Quote SQLAlchemy database model
- Quote model stores data in `quote_data` JSONB field
- PDF service tried to access `quote.items` directly

### 19:45 - Fix Bug #3
- Modified app/routes/quotes.py:580
- Pass `quote.quote_data` instead of `quote` to PDF service
- Commit: 17f579b

### 19:50 - Final Rebuild and Test
- Rebuilt Docker container with all 3 fixes
- Container started successfully
- User tested PDF generation

### 19:55 - Success Confirmation
User confirmed: "Great it worked!"
- All 3 bugs fixed
- PDF generation working correctly
- No errors in console
- Ready for production deployment

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Investigation
```python
# Company model has:
class Company(Base):
    logo_filename = Column(Text, nullable=True)  # ✅ Exists
    # logo_path = ???  # ❌ Doesn't exist
```

### Quote Data Structure
```python
# Quote model structure:
class Quote(Base):
    quote_data = Column(JSONB, nullable=False)  # Contains all quote details

# quote_data keys:
# ['items', 'notes', 'client', 'quote_id', 'tax_amount', 'total_final',
#  'valid_until', 'calculated_at', 'profit_amount', 'labor_subtotal',
#  'materials_subtotal', 'indirect_costs_amount', 'subtotal_with_overhead',
#  'subtotal_before_overhead']
```

### Container Verification
```bash
# Verified fix inside container:
docker exec ventanas-beta-app cat /app/app/routes/quotes.py | grep -A 3 "logo_path"
# Output confirmed: f"static/logos/{company.logo_filename}" if company.logo_filename else None

docker exec ventanas-beta-app cat /app/templates/view_quote.html | grep -A 8 "async function generatePDF"
# Output confirmed: const originalText = button.innerHTML; before try block
```

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Branch Context Confusion**: System showed we were on wrong branch initially
   - **Solution**: Explicitly switched to hotfix branch and verified

2. **Docker Container Built from Wrong Branch**: First deployment had old code
   - **Solution**: Stopped containers, switched branch, rebuilt with --no-cache

3. **Third Bug Discovered During Testing**: Quote.quote_data access issue
   - **Learning**: Comprehensive testing essential - found bug that wouldn't be caught by static analysis

4. **Nginx Container Startup Issue**: Nginx failed to start (config mount error)
   - **Impact**: None - app container runs independently on port 8000

## Key Learnings

1. **Always verify branch before deployment**: Branch context can be confusing
2. **Database field names matter**: `logo_filename` vs `logo_path` caused critical bug
3. **JavaScript variable scoping is critical**: async/await + try/finally requires careful scope management
4. **Type mismatches between layers**: Pydantic models vs SQLAlchemy models - know your data structures
5. **JSONB field access**: Quote model uses `quote_data` JSONB - extract dict before passing to services
6. **Testing reveals hidden bugs**: Third bug only discovered through actual testing
