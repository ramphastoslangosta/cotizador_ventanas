## Glass Pricing Implementation Verification

### Test Results: ✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

#### 1. Database Connection
- ✅ Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Sample data initialization working

#### 2. Glass Materials in Database
All 7 new glass materials created with correct codes:
- ✅ VID-CLARO-4: Vidrio Claro 4mm - $85.00/m²
- ✅ VID-CLARO-6: Vidrio Claro 6mm - $120.00/m²
- ✅ VID-BRONCE-4: Vidrio Bronce 4mm - $95.00/m²
- ✅ VID-BRONCE-6: Vidrio Bronce 6mm - $135.00/m²
- ✅ VID-REFLECTIVO-6: Vidrio Reflectivo 6mm - $180.00/m²
- ✅ VID-LAMINADO-6: Vidrio Laminado 6mm - $220.00/m²
- ✅ VID-TEMP-6: Vidrio Templado 6mm - $280.00/m² (existing)

**Total**: 11 glass materials in database (6 new + 5 old)

#### 3. Database Price Retrieval
All 7 glass types retrieve prices from database (not fallback):
- ✅ claro_4mm: $85.00/m² (from database)
- ✅ claro_6mm: $120.00/m² (from database)
- ✅ bronce_4mm: $95.00/m² (from database)
- ✅ bronce_6mm: $135.00/m² (from database)
- ✅ reflectivo_6mm: $180.00/m² (from database)
- ✅ laminado_6mm: $220.00/m² (from database)
- ✅ templado_6mm: $280.00/m² (from database)

#### 4. Price Update Propagation
- ✅ Price updated in database: $120.00 → $180.00
- ✅ Cache cleared successfully
- ✅ New price retrieved correctly: $180.00
- ✅ Original price restored: $120.00

#### 5. Mapping Completeness
- ✅ All 7 glass types mapped (GLASS_TYPE_TO_MATERIAL_CODE)
- ✅ All 7 fallback prices defined (GLASS_FALLBACK_PRICES)

#### 6. Performance Caching
- ✅ Cache performance: **0.00ms** per lookup
- ✅ Target met: <5ms per lookup
- ✅ Cache clear working correctly

## Known Issues / Notes

### Old Glass Materials
The database contains 5 old glass materials from previous deployment:
- VID-DOBLE-6 (not mapped to enum)
- VID-FLOT-6 (not mapped to enum)
- VID-LAM-6 (duplicate of VID-LAMINADO-6)
- VID-REF-BR6 (duplicate of VID-REFLECTIVO-6)

**Action**: These can be deactivated or removed in production cleanup. They don't affect the new implementation.

### Migration Not Applied
The Alembic migration (004_update_glass_material_codes.py) was not run in this verification. Materials were created manually via Python script.

**Action**: In production deployment, run `alembic upgrade head` to apply migration.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Docker verification complete
2. → Ready for test environment deployment (Phase 5)

### Phase 5: Test Environment Deployment
1. Deploy to test environment (port 8001)
2. Run Alembic migration
3. Verify 7 glass materials exist
4. Test price updates via UI
5. 24-hour monitoring period
6. Deploy to production if stable

### Phase 6: Production Deployment
1. Create database backup
2. Deploy to production droplet (159.65.174.94:8000)
3. Run migration
4. Smoke tests
5. Monitor for 1 week
