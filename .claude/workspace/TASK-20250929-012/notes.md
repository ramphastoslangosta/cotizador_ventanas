# TASK-012 Session Notes

## Session Start: 2025-10-01

### Initial Investigation

**Task Description Analysis**:
- Task claims duplicates at lines 724-901 (auth) and 903-1400 (quotes)
- Target: Remove ~670 lines from main.py
- Dependencies: TASK-002 (completed)

**Actual Code Inspection**:
- Line 739: Comment says "Web form routes moved to app/routes/auth.py"
- Line 933: Comment says "Duplicate /quotes route removed - handled by quotes router"
- Need to verify if duplicates actually exist

**Router Registration Status**:
- app/routes/auth.py router: ✅ Registered (line 169-170)
- app/routes/quotes.py router: ✅ Registered (line 173-175)
- app/routes/work_orders.py router: ✅ Registered (line 180)
- app/routes/materials.py router: ✅ Registered (line 181)

**Route Count**: 104 total routes (confirmed working)

### Key Questions to Answer

1. ❓ Are there actually duplicate @app decorators in lines 724-901?
2. ❓ Are there actually duplicate @app decorators in lines 903-1400?
3. ❓ Was this cleanup already done in TASK-001 and HOTFIX-001?
4. ❓ Is this a documentation task rather than code cleanup?

### Action Items

- [ ] Run grep to count @app decorators in specified line ranges
- [ ] Compare routes in main.py vs routers
- [ ] Determine scenario (duplicates exist vs already clean)
- [ ] Execute appropriate branch of atomic plan

### Observations

**Step 1.1 Verification Complete (2025-10-01 - Execution)**

Investigation Results:
- ✅ Router registration: All 4 routers properly imported and registered
- ✅ Total routes: 104 (confirmed working)
- ✅ Auth routes in main.py: 0 (all moved to auth router - 8 routes)
- ✅ Duplicate quotes list route: 0 (removed in HOTFIX-20251001-001)
- ✅ Lines 724-901: Only 4 @app decorators (work order routes, not auth)
- ✅ Lines 903-1400: Only 21 @app decorators (core routes like materials/company, not quote duplicates)

**CONCLUSION: SCENARIO B - NO DUPLICATES FOUND**

The task description is outdated. Duplicates were already removed in:
- TASK-20250929-001 (auth routes cleanup - deployed Sept 30, 2025)
- HOTFIX-20251001-001 (quote routes cleanup - deployed Oct 1, 2025)

**Execution Path**: Following alternative path - document completion retroactively
