# Session Notes: DEVOPS-20251001-001

## 2025-10-02 - Task Planning

### Atomic Plan Generated
- Created comprehensive execution plan (6 phases, ~40 steps)
- Estimated effort: 9-13 hours (~2 work days)
- All success criteria defined
- Rollback procedures documented

### Context from HOTFIX-20251001-001
- **Issue:** Multiple rebuild attempts (6 total) didn't update container
- **Root Cause:** Python bytecode cache (.pyc files) and Docker layer caching
- **Impact:** 4+ hour deployment delay during emergency hotfix
- **Resolution:** Manual intervention with `--no-cache` flag

### Key Improvements Planned
1. Automatic Python cache clearing in Dockerfile
2. Build verification step to confirm code changes
3. Automated deployment scripts with verification
4. Comprehensive deployment runbook

### Files to be Modified/Created
- Modify: Dockerfile
- Modify: docker-compose.beta.yml
- Create: scripts/deploy-production.sh
- Create: scripts/deploy-test.sh
- Create: docker-compose.test.yml
- Create: docs/DEPLOYMENT-RUNBOOK.md
- Modify: CLAUDE.md

### Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk:** Changes core deployment process
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing in test environment first
- **Rollback:** All changes are reversible via git

## Next Session Tasks

1. Create branch: `devops/docker-build-improvements-20251001`
2. Backup current Docker files
3. Begin Phase 2: Implementation
4. Start with Dockerfile changes (Python cache clearing)

## Questions / Blockers

None currently.

---

## Observations

- Task is well-scoped based on RCA findings
- Clear path forward with atomic plan
- Test environment (port 8001) available for validation
- Production deployment should wait for 24h test monitoring
