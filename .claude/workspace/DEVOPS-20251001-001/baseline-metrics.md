=== BASELINE BUILD METRICS ===
Date: $(date)

## Current Build Command:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.beta.yml build app
```

## Current Dockerfile (60 lines)
- Base image: python:3.11-slim
- Working directory: /app
- Dependencies: requirements.txt
- Current build approach: Standard COPY and pip install

## Known Issues (from HOTFIX-20251001-001)
- Python bytecode cache (.pyc files) persists between builds
- Docker layer caching prevents code updates from being reflected
- Required multiple rebuilds with --no-cache flag
- 6 rebuild attempts needed during hotfix deployment

## Build Process Problems
1. **Stale Code Issue**: Code changes not reflected in container
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Manual --no-cache flag required
3. **No Verification**: No confirmation that code is correctly copied
4. **Deployment Time**: Multiple rebuild attempts add 10+ minutes

## Target Improvements
- Automatic Python cache clearing
- Build verification step
- Deployment scripts with verification
- Health check improvements
