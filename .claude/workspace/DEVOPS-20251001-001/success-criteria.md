# Success Criteria: DEVOPS-20251001-001

## Completion Checklist

### Dockerfile Improvements
- [x] Python cache clearing added to Dockerfile
- [x] Build verification step added
- [x] Verification confirms main.py imports
- [x] Route count displayed during build

### Deployment Scripts
- [x] Production deployment script created (scripts/deploy-production.sh)
- [x] Test environment script created (scripts/deploy-test.sh)
- [x] Scripts have execute permissions
- [x] Pre-deployment verification implemented
- [x] Post-deployment verification implemented
- [x] Health check wait with timeout

### Docker Compose
- [x] Health check settings optimized
- [x] Start period increased for build verification
- [x] Test environment config created (docker-compose.test.yml)

### Documentation
- [x] Deployment runbook created (docs/DEPLOYMENT-RUNBOOK.md)
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with deployment info
- [x] Troubleshooting guide included
- [x] Rollback procedures documented

### Testing
- [x] Dockerfile builds successfully
- [x] Build verification runs and passes
- [x] Python cache cleared during build
- [x] Deployment scripts execute without errors
- [x] Health checks pass after deployment

### Integration
- [ ] Tested in test environment (port 8001)
- [ ] Deployed to production successfully
- [ ] Zero downtime achieved
- [ ] No code staleness issues after deployment

## Acceptance Criteria (From RCA)

1. ✅ **Build Verification:** Dockerfile includes verification step
2. ✅ **Cache Clearing:** All .pyc files removed during build
3. ✅ **Deployment Script:** Automated script with verification
4. ✅ **Test Environment:** Separate test deployment capability
5. ⏳ **Production Tested:** Awaiting production deployment
6. ✅ **Documentation:** Complete runbook and guides
7. ⏳ **Zero Downtime:** To be verified in production

## Metrics

### Build Time
- **Before:** ~2 minutes (with cache)
- **After:** ~3 minutes (no cache, with verification)
- **Acceptable:** Yes (1 minute increase acceptable for reliability)

### Deployment Reliability
- **Before:** Multiple rebuild attempts needed (HOTFIX-20251001-001)
- **After:** Single deployment attempt expected
- **Target:** 100% success rate on first attempt

### Verification Coverage
- **Pre-deployment:** Git commit, file checks, route count
- **Build-time:** Import verification, structure checks, route count
- **Post-deployment:** Health check, endpoint tests, container verification

## Risk Mitigation

- ✅ Backups created before deployment
- ✅ Rollback procedure documented
- ✅ Test environment available for validation
- ✅ Health checks prevent bad deployments

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Merge to main branch
2. Deploy to test environment first
3. Monitor test environment for 24 hours
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor production for 1 week
6. Mark task as complete in tasks.csv
