# Successful Test Deployment: ARCH-20251017-001

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Environment**: Test (http://159.65.174.94:8001)
**Branch**: arch/glass-selection-database-20251017
**Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY**

---

## Deployment Summary

Successfully deployed ARCH-20251017-001 (Glass Selection Database Migration) to test environment after resolving two critical infrastructure issues.

---

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue #1: SSH Connection Instability ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: SSH commands to droplet were failing with "Broken pipe" errors immediately after connection.

**Root Cause**: SSH receive window filled due to server shell outputting during initialization, causing connections to drop (`rwindow 0`).

**Solution**: Created `~/.ssh/config` with keepalive settings:
```ssh
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    IPQoS throughput
```

**Result**: SSH connection stable, all commands execute successfully.

---

### Issue #2: Docker Networking Failure ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: POST `/web/login` returned HTTP 500 Internal Server Error on BOTH main and feature branches.

**Root Cause**:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: could not translate host name "ventanas-test-db"
to address: Temporary failure in name resolution
```

App container could not resolve database container hostname. During initial deployment:
1. Ran `docker-compose down` (removed network)
2. Ran `docker-compose up -d` (created new network with only app)
3. Database and Redis containers remained running on OLD network (orphaned)

**Solution**:
```bash
# Stop all containers and remove old network
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down

# Start all containers together
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Connect orphaned containers to new network
docker network connect app-test_default ventanas-test-db
docker network connect app-test_default ventanas-test-redis
```

**Result**: All containers on same network, database resolution working, application started successfully.

---

## Deployment Steps Executed

### 1. SSH Connection Fix
- Created SSH config with keepalive settings
- Verified stable connection to droplet

### 2. Rollback to Main Branch
```bash
cd /home/ventanas/app-test
git checkout main
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml restart app
```
**Result**: Discovered 500 error existed on main branch too (networking issue, not code issue).

### 3. Docker Networking Fix
```bash
# Stop all containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down

# Start all containers together
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Connect orphaned containers
docker network connect app-test_default ventanas-test-db
docker network connect app-test_default ventanas-test-redis
```
**Result**: Database connectivity restored, login working on main branch.

### 4. Feature Branch Deployment
```bash
cd /home/ventanas/app-test
git checkout arch/glass-selection-database-20251017
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml restart app
```
**Result**: Feature branch deployed successfully.

## Manual Testing Required

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Browser Testing Needed

The following tests **must be performed manually** by a human user to verify full functionality:

- [ ] Click "Agregar Material" (Add Material)
- [ ] Create new glass material:
   - Name: Vidrio Test 27Oct2025
   - Code: VID-TEST-27OCT
   - Category: Vidrio
   - Cost: $999.00
   - Unit: M2

## Known Issues

### Non-Blocking Warnings

**bcrypt version warning**:
```
WARNING - (trapped) error reading bcrypt version
AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'
```
**Impact**: None - authentication still works correctly
**Cause**: bcrypt library version mismatch (cosmetic warning)
**Action**: Can be ignored or fixed in future dependency update

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Docker Networking with Orphaned Containers

**Problem**: When using `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up -d`, orphaned containers (not defined in compose file) remain on old network.

**Solution**:
- Always use `docker-compose down` to clean up network
- Then `docker-compose up -d` to create fresh network
- Manually connect orphaned containers: `docker network connect`
- OR define all services in docker-compose.yml

**Prevention**: Update `docker-compose.test.yml` to include db and redis services, or document proper startup procedure.

### 2. SSH Connection Stability

**Problem**: Default SSH settings can cause connections to drop during command execution.

**Solution**: Configure SSH keepalives in `~/.ssh/config` for all hosts.

**Best Practice**: Always test SSH stability before deploying to remote environments.

### 3. Rollback Reveals Root Cause

**Lesson**: Rollback to known-working state (main branch) revealed the issue was environmental (Docker networking), not code-related (feature branch).

**Best Practice**: When deployment fails, always test if main branch works before assuming code is broken.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (0-24 hours)

1. **Complete manual testing** (checklist above)
2. **Monitor test environment** logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker logs ventanas-test-app -f | grep -i "glass\|error"
   ```
3. **Report any issues** discovered during manual testing

### Short-term (24-48 hours)

4. Monitor for 24 hours minimum before production deployment
5. Check error count:
   ```bash
   docker logs ventanas-test-app --since 24h | grep -i error | wc -l
   ```
6. Verify no performance degradation

### Production Deployment (After 24h monitoring + manual tests pass)

7. Create database backup
8. Deploy to production (port 8000)
9. Run production smoke tests
10. Monitor for 48 hours
11. Update MTENANT-20251006-012 (unblock dependent task)
