## Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Docker Container Running Old Code
**Problem**:
After completing Steps 1-7 and testing in Docker, dropdown showed only 7 hardcoded enum options instead of 11 database materials. User provided screenshot showing old enum values (Claro 4Mm, Claro 6Mm, etc.) instead of database material names.

**Root Cause**:
Docker container was using cached image from previous build. File changes on host were not reflected in running container.

**Resolution**:
1. Stopped all containers: `docker-compose down`
2. Rebuilt with no-cache: `docker-compose up -d --build app`
3. Verified new code deployed by checking dropdown in browser

**Commit**: N/A (deployment fix, not code fix)
**Time Lost**: 5 minutes

---

### Issue 2: Missing DatabaseMaterialService Method
**Problem**:
After rebuilding container, accessing /quotes/new returned HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. User reported: "GET http://localhost:8000/quotes/new 500 (Internal Server Error)"

**Root Cause**:
Code in app/routes/quotes.py called `material_service.get_materials_by_category('Vidrio')` but this method didn't exist in DatabaseMaterialService class. Method was assumed to exist but was never implemented.

**Error Message**:
```
AttributeError: 'DatabaseMaterialService' object has no attribute 'get_materials_by_category'
```

**Resolution**:
Added missing method to database.py (DatabaseMaterialService class):
```python
def get_materials_by_category(self, category: str):
    """Get all active materials by category"""
    return self.db.query(AppMaterial).filter(
        AppMaterial.category == category,
        AppMaterial.is_active == True
    ).all()
```

**Commit**: 796e6cd
**Time Lost**: 10 minutes

---

### Issue 3: Pydantic Validator Logic Error
**Problem**:
After fixing Issue #2, dropdown displayed correctly but live calculation got stuck at "Desglose en Vivo (Calculando...)". User provided screenshot showing calculation spinner stuck.

**Root Cause**:
Used `@validator('selected_glass_material_id', 'selected_glass_type')` decorator which runs per-field. When validating `selected_glass_material_id`, that field isn't in the `values` dict yet (it's in the `v` parameter being validated). When validating `selected_glass_type`, it also isn't in `values` yet. Both fields appeared None even when one was provided.

**Error Message**:
```
VALIDATION ERROR: Must provide either selected_glass_type or selected_glass_material_id
```

**Resolution**:
Changed from `@validator` to `@root_validator(skip_on_failure=True)` which runs AFTER all fields are set:
```python
@root_validator(skip_on_failure=True)
def validate_glass_selection(cls, values):
    glass_type = values.get('selected_glass_type')
    glass_material_id = values.get('selected_glass_material_id')
    if glass_type is None and glass_material_id is None:
        raise ValueError('Must provide either...')
    return values
```

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

### Issue 4: Form Submission Validation Checking Wrong Field
**Problem**:
Live calculation working but form submission failed with message: "Por favor selecciona el tipo de vidrio para la ventana 1". User reported calculation preview worked but quote generation failed.

**Root Cause**:
JavaScript validation in new_quote.html was checking `item.selected_glass_type` (old enum field) instead of `item.selected_glass_material_id` (new database ID field). Since new quotes don't set the old field, validation failed even though glass was selected.

**Resolution**:
1. Changed validation check from `if (!item.selected_glass_type)` to `if (!item.selected_glass_material_id)`
2. Added glassMaterialsMap and helper function getGlassMaterialName()
3. Updated all preview displays to use getGlassMaterialName(item.selected_glass_material_id)
4. Fixed validation message display to show correct glass material name

**Files Modified**:
- templates/new_quote.html (lines 315-319, 393-397, 773, 864, 990)

**Commit**: bb9362d
**Time Lost**: 10 minutes

---

### Issue 5: SSH Connection Instability (Test Deployment)
**Problem**:
During test environment deployment (2025-10-27), SSH commands to droplet were failing with "Broken pipe" errors immediately after connection. User reported: "client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe"

**Root Cause**:
SSH receive window filled (`rwindow 0`) due to server shell outputting during initialization, causing connections to drop before commands could execute.

**Resolution**:
User created `~/.ssh/config` with keepalive settings:
```
Host *
    ServerAliveInterval 30
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    IPQoS throughput
```

**Resolved By**: Rafael Lang
**Commit**: N/A (local SSH configuration)
**Time Lost**: 30 minutes

---

### Issue 6: Docker Networking Failure (Test Deployment)
**Problem**:
After deploying to test environment, POST /web/login returned HTTP 500 Internal Server Error on BOTH main and feature branches. User reported: "POST http://159.65.174.94:8001/web/login 500 (Internal Server Error)"

**Root Cause**:
App container couldn't resolve database container hostname. Error: `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: could not translate host name "ventanas-test-db" to address: Temporary failure in name resolution`

During deployment:
1. Ran `docker-compose down` (removed network)
2. Ran `docker-compose up -d` (created new network with only app)
3. Database and Redis containers remained running on OLD network (orphaned)

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Stop all containers and remove old network
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down

# Start all containers together
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d

# Connect orphaned containers to new network
docker network connect app-test_default ventanas-test-db
docker network connect app-test_default ventanas-test-redis
```

**Resolved By**: Claude Code
**Commit**: N/A (infrastructure fix)
**Time Lost**: 90 minutes

---

### Issue 7: Edit Quote JavaScript TypeError (Test & Local)
**Problem**:
After successful deployment, user tested edit quote functionality and reported: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')" at templates/edit_quote.html:433. Bug present on both local Docker and test droplet, but NOT on production.

**Root Cause**:
JavaScript quirk where `typeof null === 'object'` returns true. Code was checking:
```javascript
if (typeof item.selected_glass_type === 'object') {
    item.selected_glass_type = item.selected_glass_type.value || item.selected_glass_type;
}
```

When `selected_glass_type` was `null` (for quotes created before migration), condition passed and code tried to access `null.value`, causing TypeError.

**Resolution**:
Added null check before typeof check in TWO locations (lines 215, 252):
```javascript
// BUGFIX-20251027: Add null check (typeof null === 'object' in JS!)
if (item.selected_glass_type && typeof item.selected_glass_type === 'object') {
    item.selected_glass_type = item.selected_glass_type.value || item.selected_glass_type;
}
```

Also added backward compatibility converter (lines 219-234) to map old enum values to new material IDs.

**Deployment Challenge**:
Docker containers copy templates during BUILD, not at runtime. Templates NOT volume-mounted. Required full rebuild:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.beta.yml build --no-cache app
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build --no-cache app
```

**Resolved By**: Claude Code
**Tested By**: Rafael Lang
**Commit**: 9d341f1
**Time Lost**: 55 minutes (including rebuild time)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Atomic plan provided clear step-by-step roadmap
- Dual-path architecture enabled backward compatibility
- Docker environment testing caught all issues before production
- LRU caching maintained performance parity
- All initial implementation issues resolved within same session (3.2 hours)
- Test deployment issues resolved systematically (3.9 hours)
- Rollback to main branch helped identify infrastructure vs. code issues
- Manual browser testing caught critical JavaScript bug before production

### What Could Be Improved
- Should have added get_materials_by_category() method during preparation phase
- Could have caught validator issue earlier with unit tests
- Template validation patterns should be standardized across all forms
- JavaScript null checks should be added proactively for all object type checks
- Should have tested edit quote functionality immediately after deployment
- Could have documented that templates require rebuild (not volume-mounted)

### Deployment Lessons
- **SSH Stability**: Always configure SSH keepalives for remote deployments
- **Docker Networking**: When using `docker-compose down`, orphaned containers remain on old network - reconnect manually or include all services in compose file
- **Rollback Testing**: Test main branch when deployment fails to identify if issue is environmental or code-related
- **Template Updates**: Docker containers copy files during BUILD - template changes require `build --no-cache`
- **JavaScript Type Checking**: Always add null checks before `typeof` checks (`value && typeof value === 'object'`)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migration code (enum → material_id) successfully handled existing data

### Future Recommendations
- Apply same pattern to WindowType enum (future task)
- Apply same pattern to AluminumLine enum (future task)
- Create reusable helper functions for material dropdowns
- Add integration tests for form validation logic
- Document Pydantic validator patterns (per-field vs root validator)
- Consider creating utility class for database-driven dropdowns
- Update docker-compose.test.yml to include db and redis services (prevent orphaned containers)
- Add JavaScript null safety linting rules
- Create pre-deployment checklist including edit functionality testing
