## Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Docker Container Running Old Code
**Problem**:
After completing Steps 1-7 and testing in Docker, dropdown showed only 7 hardcoded enum options instead of 11 database materials. User provided screenshot showing old enum values (Claro 4Mm, Claro 6Mm, etc.) instead of database material names.

**Root Cause**:
Docker container was using cached image from previous build. File changes on host were not reflected in running container.

**Resolution**:
1. Stopped all containers: `docker-compose down`
2. Rebuilt with no-cache: `docker-compose up -d --build app`
3. Verified new code deployed by checking dropdown in browser

**Commit**: N/A (deployment fix, not code fix)
**Time Lost**: 5 minutes

---

### Issue 2: Missing DatabaseMaterialService Method
**Problem**:
After rebuilding container, accessing /quotes/new returned HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. User reported: "GET http://localhost:8000/quotes/new 500 (Internal Server Error)"

**Root Cause**:
Code in app/routes/quotes.py called `material_service.get_materials_by_category('Vidrio')` but this method didn't exist in DatabaseMaterialService class. Method was assumed to exist but was never implemented.

**Error Message**:
```
AttributeError: 'DatabaseMaterialService' object has no attribute 'get_materials_by_category'
```

**Resolution**:
Added missing method to database.py (DatabaseMaterialService class):
```python
def get_materials_by_category(self, category: str):
    """Get all active materials by category"""
    return self.db.query(AppMaterial).filter(
        AppMaterial.category == category,
        AppMaterial.is_active == True
    ).all()
```

**Commit**: 796e6cd
**Time Lost**: 10 minutes

### Issue 3: Pydantic Validator Logic Error
**Problem**:
After fixing Issue #2, dropdown displayed correctly but live calculation got stuck at "Desglose en Vivo (Calculando...)". User provided screenshot showing calculation spinner stuck.

**Root Cause**:
Used `@validator('selected_glass_material_id', 'selected_glass_type')` decorator which runs per-field. When validating `selected_glass_material_id`, that field isn't in the `values` dict yet (it's in the `v` parameter being validated). When validating `selected_glass_type`, it also isn't in `values` yet. Both fields appeared None even when one was provided.

**Error Message**:
```
VALIDATION ERROR: Must provide either selected_glass_type or selected_glass_material_id
```

**Resolution**:
Changed from `@validator` to `@root_validator(skip_on_failure=True)` which runs AFTER all fields are set:
```python
@root_validator(skip_on_failure=True)
def validate_glass_selection(cls, values):
    glass_type = values.get('selected_glass_type')
    glass_material_id = values.get('selected_glass_material_id')
    if glass_type is None and glass_material_id is None:
        raise ValueError('Must provide either...')
    return values
```

**Time Lost**: 15 minutes

### Issue 4: Form Submission Validation Checking Wrong Field
**Problem**:
Live calculation working but form submission failed with message: "Por favor selecciona el tipo de vidrio para la ventana 1". User reported calculation preview worked but quote generation failed.

**Root Cause**:
JavaScript validation in new_quote.html was checking `item.selected_glass_type` (old enum field) instead of `item.selected_glass_material_id` (new database ID field). Since new quotes don't set the old field, validation failed even though glass was selected.

**Resolution**:
1. Changed validation check from `if (!item.selected_glass_type)` to `if (!item.selected_glass_material_id)`
2. Added glassMaterialsMap and helper function getGlassMaterialName()
3. Updated all preview displays to use getGlassMaterialName(item.selected_glass_material_id)
4. Fixed validation message display to show correct glass material name

**Files Modified**:
- templates/new_quote.html (lines 315-319, 393-397, 773, 864, 990)

**Commit**: bb9362d
**Time Lost**: 10 minutes

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Atomic plan provided clear step-by-step roadmap
- Dual-path architecture enabled backward compatibility
- Docker environment testing caught all issues before production
- LRU caching maintained performance parity
- All issues resolved within same session

### What Could Be Improved
- Should have added get_materials_by_category() method during preparation phase
- Could have caught validator issue earlier with unit tests
- Template validation patterns should be standardized across all forms

### Future Recommendations
- Apply same pattern to WindowType enum (future task)
- Apply same pattern to AluminumLine enum (future task)
- Create reusable helper functions for material dropdowns
- Add integration tests for form validation logic
- Document Pydantic validator patterns (per-field vs root validator)
- Consider creating utility class for database-driven dropdowns

| Documentation | 30 min | 15 min | -15 min |
| **TOTAL** | **11-16 hrs** | **3.2 hrs** | **-8 hrs** |

**Notes**: Task completed much faster than estimated due to:
- Clear atomic plan reduced planning overhead
- Local Docker testing (no remote deployment)
- No unit test writing required (reused existing tests)
- Most steps straightforward pattern application
