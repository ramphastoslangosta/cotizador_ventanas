## Test Coverage Criteria

### Route Coverage
- [ ] GET /quotes route: 100% line coverage
- [ ] GET /quotes route: 100% branch coverage
- [ ] All code paths exercised (empty state, single quote, pagination)
- [ ] Error handling paths tested

### Presenter Coverage
- [ ] QuoteListPresenter.present(): 100% line coverage
- [ ] QuoteListPresenter.present(): 100% branch coverage
- [ ] All data transformation logic tested
- [ ] Error handling tested (corrupted data, missing fields)

### Database Service Coverage
- [ ] DatabaseQuoteService.get_quotes_by_user(): pagination tested
- [ ] Limit parameter verified
- [ ] Offset parameter verified
- [ ] Edge cases covered (offset beyond total, empty results)

---

## Functional Test Criteria

### Template Rendering
- [ ] Template renders with valid HTML structure
- [ ] User info displays correctly in header
- [ ] Quote data renders in table/list format
- [ ] Pagination controls display when appropriate
- [ ] Empty state message displays with no quotes

### Data Compatibility
- [ ] Router returns correct data structure for template
- [ ] All required fields present (id, created_at, client_name, total_final)
- [ ] Calculated fields present (total_area, price_per_m2, items_count)
- [ ] Sample items array populated correctly
- [ ] Remaining items count calculated correctly

### Pagination Functionality
- [ ] First page shows most recent quotes (newest first)
- [ ] Second page shows older quotes
- [ ] No overlap between pages
- [ ] Correct number of quotes per page (limit: 20)
- [ ] Page navigation controls work
- [ ] Invalid page parameter handled gracefully

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty state (0 quotes) handled correctly
- [ ] Single quote displays properly
- [ ] Exactly 20 quotes (one full page) handled
- [ ] 21+ quotes (multiple pages) handled
- [ ] Offset beyond total returns empty list (not error)

## Final Verification Commands

### Run Tests
```bash
# All integration tests pass
pytest tests/test_integration_quotes_routes.py -v
# ✅ Expected: 15 passed in <30s

# Full test suite passes
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
# ✅ Expected: All tests pass, no regressions
```

### Check Coverage
```bash
# Generate coverage report
pytest tests/test_integration_quotes_routes.py \
  --cov=app.routes.quotes \
  --cov=app.presenters.quote_presenter \
  --cov=database \
  --cov-report=term-missing

# ✅ Expected:
# - app/routes/quotes.py: >95%
# - app/presenters/quote_presenter.py: 100%
# - database.py: >90%
```

### Verify Documentation
