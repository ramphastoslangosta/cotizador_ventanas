# Complete Development Pipeline Guide

**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Purpose**: Document the complete SDLC pipeline for all tasks

---

## üìã Development Pipeline Stages

Every task should go through these stages, reflected in tasks.csv status field:

### Stage 1: Development (`in-progress`)
- Coding on feature branch
- Unit tests created
- Integration tests created
- Local testing complete

### Stage 2: Code Review (`code-review`)
- Peer review completed
- All review comments addressed
- Branch ready to merge

### Stage 3: Merged to Main (`merged`)
- Merged to main branch with --no-ff
- Pushed to GitHub
- Ready for test deployment

### Stage 4: Test Environment (`deployed-test`)
- Deployed to test droplet (port 8001)
- Database migrations applied
- Initial smoke tests passed
- 24-hour monitoring in progress

### Stage 5: Test Monitoring (`monitoring-test`)
- 24-hour monitoring period active
- Hourly/4-hour checks performed
- Issues tracked and resolved
- Final decision: APPROVE or ROLLBACK

### Stage 6: Production Deployment (`deployed-production`)
- Deployed to production droplet (port 8000)
- Database migrations applied
- Production smoke tests passed
- Beta users notified

### Stage 7: Production Monitoring (`monitoring-production`)
- 7-day monitoring period
- Daily health checks

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### Test Environment (Port 8001)

```bash
# 1. Ensure on main branch with latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Deploy to test
bash scripts/deploy-test.sh

# 3. Verify deployment
curl http://159.65.174.94:8001/api/health

# 4. Apply database migrations (if any)
docker exec ventanas-test-app alembic upgrade head

# 5. Verify migration
docker exec ventanas-test-db psql -U ventanas_user -d ventanas_test_db \
  -c "\dt"  # List tables

# 6. Run smoke tests
# - Open http://159.65.174.94:8001
# - Test key functionality
# - Check logs: docker logs ventanas-test-app --tail 100
```

### Production Environment (Port 8000)

**ONLY after 24-hour test monitoring passes**

```bash
# 1. Backup production database
docker exec ventanas-prod-db pg_dump -U ventanas_user ventanas_db > \
  backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 2. Deploy to production
bash scripts/deploy-production.sh

# 3. Apply migrations
docker exec ventanas-prod-app alembic upgrade head

# 4. Verify deployment
curl http://159.65.174.94:8000/api/health

# 5. Production smoke tests
# - Open http://159.65.174.94:8000
# - Test all features
# - Notify beta users
```

## üìù tasks.csv Notes Field Format

Use the `notes` field (last column) to track deployment pipeline status:

```
"üöÄ DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION (Date) - MONITORING COMPLETE.
‚úÖ TEST ENV (Date) - 24h monitoring passed, zero issues.
‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE (Date) - Brief summary.
DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE: [1/4] ‚úÖ Code [2/4] ‚úÖ Merged [3/4] ‚úÖ Test [4/4] ‚úÖ Prod"
```

**Example (Complete Pipeline)**:
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Always** use `--no-ff` for merges (preserve commit history)
2. **Always** push to GitHub before deploying
3. **Always** deploy to test before production
4. **Always** monitor test for 24 hours minimum
5. **Always** backup production database before deploying
6. **Never** skip the monitoring period
7. **Never** deploy on Fridays (weekend monitoring difficult)
8. **Never** deploy without smoke tests
9. **Document** every deployment in workspace
10. **Update** tasks.csv status after each stage
