## 1. Overview

### Purpose

This protocol provides a **step-by-step, battle-tested process** for safely extracting routes from `main.py` into modular routers under `app/routes/`. It was created in response to **HOTFIX-20251001-001**, a production incident caused by incomplete route extraction.

**Key Principle:** **Gradual transition with parallel operation** until verified.

### Background

The FastAPI Window Quotation System originally had all routes in a 2,273-line `main.py`. During refactoring (TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003), routes were extracted to:
- `app/routes/auth.py` ‚úÖ Successful
- `app/routes/quotes.py` ‚ö†Ô∏è Caused production incident
- `app/routes/materials.py` ‚úÖ Successful
- `app/routes/work_orders.py` ‚úÖ Successful

**The quotes router incident revealed critical gaps in our extraction process.**

### Core Philosophy

```
KEEP OLD ‚Üí ADD NEW ‚Üí TEST BOTH ‚Üí VERIFY NEW ‚Üí REMOVE OLD
     ‚Üì          ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì            ‚Üì
  Safe      Parallel   Redundancy  Confidence   Clean
```

**NOT:** ~~Remove old ‚Üí Add new ‚Üí Hope it works~~ ‚ùå

## 2. When to Use This Protocol

### Required Situations

Use this protocol for:

‚úÖ **Any route extraction from main.py to modular routers**
‚úÖ **Refactoring routes that involve data processing**
‚úÖ **Routes with template dependencies**
‚úÖ **Routes with complex business logic**
‚úÖ **High-traffic production endpoints**

### Optional Situations (Still Recommended)

Consider using for:
- New route creation (follow structure, skip extraction steps)
- Internal API endpoints (lower risk)
- Development-only routes

### When NOT to Use

Skip this protocol for:
- ‚ùå Static file routes
- ‚ùå Health check endpoints
- ‚ùå OpenAPI documentation routes
