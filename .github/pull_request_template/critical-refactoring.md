### Design Patterns Applied
- [ ] Service Layer Pattern
- [ ] Repository Pattern
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Factory Pattern

- [ ] Other: ___________

### SOLID Principles Compliance
- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle - Each module has one reason to change
- [ ] Open/Closed Principle - Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] Liskov Substitution Principle - Derived classes are substitutable
- [ ] Interface Segregation Principle - No client depends on unused methods
- [ ] Dependency Inversion Principle - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Performance Impact

### Response Time Impact
| Endpoint | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Example endpoint | XXms | XXms | +/-X% |

### Database Query Impact
- Query count change: <!-- e.g., -20 queries -->
- Average query time: <!-- e.g., 45ms â†’ 30ms -->

### Memory Usage
- Before: <!-- e.g., 250MB -->
- After: <!-- e.g., 200MB -->
- Change: <!-- e.g., -20% -->

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Level
- [ ] LOW - Minor refactoring, limited scope
- [ ] MEDIUM - Moderate changes, some risk
- [ ] HIGH - Major architectural changes
- [ ] CRITICAL - Core functionality modified

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. <!-- Strategy 1 -->
2. <!-- Strategy 2 -->
3. <!-- Strategy 3 -->

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Fully backward compatible - No API changes
- [ ] Minor breaking changes - List below:
  - <!-- Breaking change 1 -->
- [ ] Major breaking changes - Migration guide required

### Database Changes
- [ ] No database changes
- [ ] Schema changes required - Migration script: `migrations/XXXX.py`
- [ ] Data migration needed - Script: `migrations/data_XXXX.py`

## Rollback Procedure

### Quick Rollback (Production Emergency)
```bash
# Step 1: Revert merge commit
git checkout main
git revert <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Step 2: Restart application
# (Add deployment-specific commands)

# Step 3: Verify rollback
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Database Rollback (if applicable)
```bash
# Rollback database migrations
alembic downgrade -1

# Or manual SQL rollback
psql -d cotizador_db -f migrations/rollback_XXXX.sql
```

### Monitoring After Rollback
- [ ] Check error rates in logs
- [ ] Verify critical endpoints functional
- [ ] Monitor database connection pool
- [ ] Check authentication flow

---

## Deployment Checklist
