## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure

#### Before Architecture
```python
# Example: Before implementing pattern
class MonolithicClass:
    def do_everything(self):
        # Multiple responsibilities
        # Tightly coupled
        # Hard to test
        pass
```

#### After Architecture
```python
# Example: After implementing pattern
class Interface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self):
        pass

class ConcreteImplementation(Interface):
    def execute(self):
        # Single responsibility
        # Loosely coupled
        # Easy to test
        pass
```

### Files Modified
<!-- List all modified files -->
- `file1.py` - Refactored to implement interface
- `file2.py` - Extracted responsibilities into separate classes

### Files Created
<!-- List new files with purpose -->
- `interfaces/base_service.py` - Abstract base class for services
- `factories/model_factory.py` - Factory for model creation
- `commands/quote_command.py` - Command pattern implementation

## Code Examples

### Usage Example 1: Basic Pattern Usage
```python
# Example showing how to use the new pattern
from factories import QuoteFactory
from commands import CalculateQuoteCommand

# Create quote using factory
quote = QuoteFactory.create_from_data(data)

# Execute calculation using command
command = CalculateQuoteCommand(quote_service, quote)
result = command.execute()

if result.success:
    print(f"Quote calculated: {result.total}")
```

### Usage Example 2: Advanced Scenario
```python
# Example showing advanced usage
from strategies import BOMCalculationStrategy

# Strategy pattern for different calculation methods
strategy = StandardBOMStrategy()  # or PremiumBOMStrategy()
calculator = BOMCalculator(strategy)
result = calculator.calculate(product, dimensions)
```

### Migration Example
```python
# Before: Old way
def calculate_quote(data):
    # Monolithic calculation
    pass

# After: New pattern
# Step 1: Create command
command = CalculateQuoteCommand(service, data)

# Step 2: Execute
result = command.execute()

# Step 3: Handle result
if result.success:
    return result.data
```
